HOW TO USE:
STEP 1 : Simply replace the twitch username and the discord webhook url by yours in config.json .
STEP 2 : Add a Browser to your main OBS Scene (the one where you will start your stream)
STEP 3 : Choose plugin.html for the file
STEP 4 : Hide the Browser
STEP 5 : Push the Go Live Button üëç

It takes 60 second before sending the discord webhook because twitch cannot go faster :)
