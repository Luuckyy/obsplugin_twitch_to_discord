HOW TO USE:
STEP 1 : Simply replace the twitch username and the discord webhook url by yours in config.json .
STEP 2 : Add a Browser to your main OBS Scene (the one where you will start your stream)
STEP 3 : Choose plugin.html for the file
STEP 4 : Hide the Browser
STEP 5 : Push the Go Live Button üëç

It takes 60 seconds before sending the discord webhook because twitch cannot go faster :)

Why did i make this when mee6 exists ?
Well with the webhook you can personify the bot (i was bored)

I will make a new variable in config.json so you can type your personal message
